## Description

A complete responsive table and form builders connected to a store for managing state using redux and saga middleware for handling side effects.<br />
The table and form builders are in components/ and they are used in pages/ where we have two pages; products list and product form. <br />
Products list and product form represents the demo to show how we can benefit from builders. <br />
Please don't bother yourself with code outside src/ as most of it is related to the build as I have commited the build files to deploy the demo to the github pages https://nermeen-mattar.github.io/react-table-form/ <br />
Tested on all device sizes.
